# Makes Recommender System: A Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) Approach
#
# Igor Mol <igor.mol@makes.ai>
#
# Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) is a collaborative filtering algorithm commonly
# used in recommender systems. It focuses on predicting the ranking order of items for
# a user based on their historical interactions. In BPR, the core idea is to model the
# preferences of a user by considering pairwise item comparisons rather than explicit
# ratings.
#
# The algorithm assumes that users prefer items they have interacted with more than
# those they have not. BPR optimizes the likelihood of observed item pairs in the
# training data, emphasizing the correct ranking of items that a user has engaged with
# over those they have not. This is achieved through a Bayesian framework, which
# incorporates prior beliefs about user preferences.
#
# During training, the algorithm adjusts model parameters to maximize the probability
# of correctly ranking observed item pairs for each user. BPR effectively captures the
# inherent user-item preferences and provides personalized recommendations by
# considering the relative ranking of items within a user's history.
#
# In summary, Bayesian Personalized Ranking is a collaborative filtering approach that
# leverages pairwise item comparisons to model user preferences, optimizing the ranking
# of observed interactions in the training data to enhance the accuracy of personalized
# recommendations.

# initialize_bpr():
# This function is responsible for setting up the initial configuration of the 
# Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model.
# 	Inside the function, the user and item latent vectors are initialized 
# using NumPy's random.normal function, generating matrices with random values 
# from a normal distribution. The dimensions of these matrices are determined by
# the number of users, number of items, and the specified latent dimensionality.
# 	The function then returns a tuple containing the initialized user latent
# matrix, item latent matrix, latent dimension, learning rate, regularization 
# parameter, and the number of epochs.

# fit_bpr():
# This function implements the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model for 
# collaborative filtering. The purpose of this function is to train the model u-
# sing stochastic gradient descent on user-item interactions.
# 	The training process involves looping through each epoch and, within ea-
# ch epoch, iterating over triplets of (user, positive item, negative item) ge-
# nerated by the generate_triplets function. For each triplet, the model compu-
# tes the scores for positive and negative items, computes the loss using a lo-
# gistic loss function, and updates the user and item latent vectors using sto-
# chastic gradient descent.
# 	The gradients are computed based on the difference between the scores of
# positive and negative items, and regularization terms are added to prevent 
# overfitting. The update rule for each parameter involves subtracting the pro-
# duct of the learning rate and the corresponding gradient.
# 	After completing each epoch, the function prints a progress message in-
# dicating the current epoch out of the total number of epochs. Finally, the 
# function returns the updated user and item latent vectors.

# generate_triplets():
# The purpose of this function is to create triplets, denoted as (user, pos_item
# , neg_item), intended for training the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) mo-
# del in collaborative filtering. The function begins by initializing an empty 
# list named triplets to store the generated triplets. It then iterates through
# each user, extracting positive items by finding non-zero entries in the inte-
#ractions matrix. Additionally, it identifies negative items by subtracting the 
# set of positive items from the set of all items.
# 	For each positive item associated with a user, the function randomly se-
# lects a negative item from the set of available negative items. This random-
# ness is introduced using NumPy's random.choice function. The resulting triplet
# composed of the user, positive item, and negative item, is appended to the 
# triplets list. To avoid duplication, the selected negative item is removed 
# from the set of available negative items. Once this process is completed for 
# all users, the function returns the list of generated triplets.

# recommend():
# This function aims to offer the top N recommendations for a specified user 
# within a collaborative filtering system. This function takes four parameters:

# - user_latent: A matrix representing the latent vectors associated with users.
# - item_latent: A matrix representing the latent vectors associated with items.
# - user: The particular user for whom recommendations are desired.
# - top_n: An optional parameter specifying the number of recommendations to 
# provide, with a default value of 5.
#
# 	The primary purpose of this function is to calculate recommendation sco-
# res for items based on the latent vectors of users and items. This is achieved
# by computing the dot product of the latent vector of the specified user and 
# the transpose of the matrix containing latent vectors for all items (item_
# latent.T). The resulting scores represent the model's estimate of the user's 
# preference for each item.
#	Subsequently, these scores are utilized to identify the top N recommen-
# ded items. The scores are sorted in descending order using the NumPy function
# argsort, and the first N items are selected using slicing ([::-1][:top_n]). 
# The function concludes by returning a list containing the indices of the reco-
# mmended items.
